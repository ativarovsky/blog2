<h3> Hi there. I'm Alice and I'm glad you stopped by. </h3> 
<p> I created this blog to explore my interest in the intersection of data science and health. Using publicly available datasets, I contribute projects spanning the areas of biostatistics, epidemiology, data visualization, and all kinds of other fun things. </p>
<p> For more on my background, check out the <a href="_pages/about">about</a> page or my <a href="_pages/resume">resum&eacute</a>.</p>
