## Why I created this blog...

...basically because everyone has a blog. Your mom, your best friend, your cat probably has a blog. As always, I'm late to the party.

## How I created this blog...

...short answer: with great difficulty. 

...slightly longer answer: I knew very little about html, css, java, and web development in general. It took me several weeks of daily work to get the setup working correctly and I had to scrap and start over at one point. I'm still working through it and I'm absolutely still a newb, but if you have any questions you can [contact me]("/contact.html"). 

I used the following tools: 
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) installed with the help of [homebrew](https://brew.sh)
* [Bundler](https://bundler.io) to manage dependencies
* [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/)
* [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Some handy tutorials: 
  - [Getting math to render](https://www.cross-validated.com/How-to-render-math-on-Minimal-Mistakes/)
  - [Converting from `.Rmd` to `.md` and preserving html widgets](https://g3rv4.com/2017/08/htmlwidgets-jekyll-rstats)
