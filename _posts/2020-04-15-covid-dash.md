For those following the Covid-19 trajectories, this `flexdashboard` not a novel concept (pun not intended). My version is adapted from Rami Krispin's [original](https://ramikrispin.github.io/coronavirus_dashboard/) and uses his `coronavirus` package. Check it out <a href="../assets/covid_dash.html">here</a>.
